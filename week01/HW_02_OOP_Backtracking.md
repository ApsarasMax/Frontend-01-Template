*   what’s OOP
    *   OOP is an architecture of programming based on objects which could contain data(fields) and functions(methods). Usually in development, we use “classes” to represent “objects”.
    *   Nowsdays major programming languages using OOP are (but not limited to) Java, C++, Python, Javascript etc.
*   History
    *   The term “objects” in OOP context was initially introduced in 1950s - 1960s. In 1966, Alan Kay gave a detailed explanation and understanding thru emails.
    *   Technically, OOP was first put into practice in Simula language in 1960s which formed the OOP programming shape in which a lot of key components are remained in modern OOP languages today.
